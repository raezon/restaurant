# Restaurant build with react js and yii2 microframework

Currently I've just setup the repo and synchronize the back-end with the front end, my application is currently running on the port 3000

and my apes are running on port 80.

I'm aiming for a realization of a restaurant website with multiple functionality which are described below:

### 1 Management of user,client,foods,categories,food ordering.
### 2 Mangement of the warehouse of the restaurant with simple Bi for some report.
### 3 Authentification and notifcation system  on the upcoming senarios ordering a plat ,creation of update of a food or a cateogy.
### 4 Notification when the warehouse is empty for a specific ingrediant .
### 5 Authorisation for getting money as ticket which will provide you with an authorisation to buy some ingrediant for the restaurant
